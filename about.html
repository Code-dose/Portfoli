  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p> I am a Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in
Web Development, Python programming, and Artificial Intelligence.
I enjoy building responsive and user-friendly web applications and solving
real-world problems through logical and efficient code.

I have worked on projects such as an Amazon Clone website, a personal portfolio,
a Student Management System, and a Calculator web application.
These projects have helped me strengthen my understanding of frontend
development, programming fundamentals, and problem-solving skills.

I am a quick learner, highly motivated, and eager to apply my technical knowledge
in a professional environment while continuously improving my skills.
